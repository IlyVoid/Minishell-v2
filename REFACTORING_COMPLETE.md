# Minishell Refactoring Complete

The Minishell project has been successfully refactored to comply with norminette rules and 42 coding standards. The following changes have been implemented:

## 1. File Structure Reorganization

### Builtins Split
- **builtins.c** has been split into:
  - `builtins_basic.c`: Contains echo and pwd commands
  - `builtins_dir.c`: Contains cd command
  - `builtins_env.c`: Contains export, unset, and env commands
  - `builtins_exit.c`: Contains exit command
  - `builtins_utils.c`: Contains helper functions (is_valid_variable_name, parse_variable_assignment, is_numeric)

### Executor Split
- **executor.c** has been split into:
  - `executor_core.c`: Contains main execution logic, builtin detection, and process execution
  - `executor_pipe.c`: Contains pipe handling and command chaining
  - `executor_redir.c`: Contains redirection handling and heredoc cleanup
  - `executor_path.c`: Contains command path resolution
  - `executor_utils.c`: Contains utility functions for execution

## 2. Code Style Improvements
- Comments converted from C++ style (`//`) to C style (`/* */`) as required by norminette
- All functions kept under 25 lines limit
- Maximum 5 functions per file
- Proper function documentation with parameter descriptions
- Standard 42 header applied to all files

## 3. Project Maintenance
- `Makefile` updated to reflect the new file structure
- `minishell.h` header updated with reorganized function declarations
- Original files removed after successful refactoring

## 4. Norminette Compliance
- All functions comply with norminette requirements:
  - Maximum 25 lines per function
  - Maximum 5 functions per file
  - Proper indentation and spacing
  - Correct comment style
  - No unnecessary comments

## 5. Functionality Preservation
- All original functionality has been maintained
- Function signatures kept the same for compatibility
- No changes to logic or behavior

The refactoring maintains the exact same functionality as the original code but now complies with all norminette requirements.
