# Minishell Refactoring - Final Summary

## Completed Refactoring Tasks

The refactoring of the Minishell project has been successfully completed. All code now complies with 42's norminette rules while maintaining the original functionality.

### File Structure Changes

1. **Builtins Split**:
   - `builtins.c` ➡️ Split into 5 specialized files:
     - `builtins_basic.c` (2334 bytes) - Contains echo and pwd commands
     - `builtins_dir.c` (3473 bytes) - Contains cd command
     - `builtins_env.c` (4078 bytes) - Contains export, unset, and env commands
     - `builtins_exit.c` (2139 bytes) - Contains exit command
     - `builtins_utils.c` (2225 bytes) - Contains helper functions

2. **Executor Split**:
   - `executor.c` ➡️ Split into 5 specialized files:
     - `executor_core.c` (4756 bytes) - Contains main execution logic
     - `executor_pipe.c` (3388 bytes) - Contains pipe handling
     - `executor_redir.c` (3039 bytes) - Contains redirection handling
     - `executor_path.c` (3108 bytes) - Contains path resolution
     - `executor_utils.c` (2181 bytes) - Contains utility functions

### Code Style Improvements

- All functions are now under 25 lines (norminette requirement)
- Each file contains at most 5 functions (norminette requirement)
- Comments converted from C++ style (`//`) to C style (`/* */`)
- Proper function documentation maintained throughout
- Standard 42 headers applied to all files

### Technical Implementation

- The `Makefile` has been updated to reflect the new file structure
- The `minishell.h` header has been updated with reorganized function declarations
- Original files have been removed
- All code maintains the exact same functionality as before

### Norminette Compliance

All files now comply with norminette requirements:
- Function line limits (25 lines max)
- File function limits (5 functions max)
- Proper comment style
- Correct indentation and spacing
- Appropriate header format

This refactoring ensures the Minishell project meets all the subject requirements while adhering to 42's coding standards.
