   - Converted comments to proper norminette style

2. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive documentation of the refactoring process
   - Verified all subject requirements are met
   - Provided detailed explanation of changes made
   - Added compilation instructions for various environments

3. **Project Structure**
