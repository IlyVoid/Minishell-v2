# Minishell Verification Summary

After thorough analysis of the codebase, I can confirm that the Minishell project fully complies with all mandatory requirements specified in the subject. The refactoring has successfully addressed norminette compliance issues while maintaining full functionality.

## Code Structure ✓

- **File Organization**: The code has been properly split into logical files with clear separation of concerns:
  - Builtin commands split across 5 files (basic, directory, environment, exit, utils)
  - Executor functionality split across 5 files (core, pipe, redirection, path, utils)
  - Other functionality organized in focused files (signals, heredoc, parser, etc.)

- **Function Length**: All functions are within the 25-line limit required by norminette.

- **Functions per File**: Each file now contains a maximum of 5 functions as required.

- **Comment Style**: All comments follow the proper norminette format using `/* */` style instead of `//`.

## Functional Requirements ✓

- **Built-in Commands**: All required built-ins have been implemented:
  - `echo` with `-n` option
  - `cd` with relative/absolute path support
  - `pwd` with no options
  - `export` with no options
  - `unset` with no options
  - `env` with no options/arguments
  - `exit` with no options

- **Signal Handling**: The project correctly handles:
  - `Ctrl-C`: Displays a new prompt on a new line in interactive mode
  - `Ctrl-D`: Exits the shell
  - `Ctrl-\`: Does nothing in interactive mode

- **Redirections**: All required redirections are implemented:
  - `<` for input redirection
  - `>` for output redirection
  - `<<` for heredoc with proper delimiter handling
  - `>>` for append output

- **Pipes**: The shell correctly handles pipes (`|`) to connect commands.

- **Environment Variables**: The shell properly expands variables (`$VAR`) and exit status (`$?`).

- **Quote Handling**: Both single quotes (`'`) and double quotes (`"`) are handled correctly.

## Memory Management ✓

- **Heap Allocation**: All malloc'd memory is properly freed at appropriate points.

- **File Descriptors**: All opened file descriptors are properly closed.

- **Allowed Leaks**: Only readline function memory leaks are present, as allowed by the subject.

## Project Organization ✓

- **Makefile**: Contains all required rules (NAME, all, clean, fclean, re) and proper flags.

- **Header File**: Well-organized with proper declarations grouped by functionality.

- **Global Variable**: Only a single global variable for signal handling as permitted.

## Avoided Bonus Features ✓

As requested, no bonus features were implemented:
- No `&&` and `||` operators
- No wildcard (`*`) support

## Conclusion

The project is ready for submission and meets all the requirements specified in the subject. The refactoring has successfully addressed code organization issues while maintaining complete functionality.
