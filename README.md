# Minishell Project

## Project Status: âœ… REFACTORING COMPLETE

The Minishell project has been successfully refactored to comply with 42's norminette rules while maintaining all functionality. The code is now properly organized in smaller files with clear separation of concerns.

## Project Structure

The project has been restructured as follows:

### Builtins Components
- `builtins_basic.c` - Echo and pwd commands
- `builtins_dir.c` - Cd command
- `builtins_env.c` - Export, unset, and env commands
- `builtins_exit.c` - Exit command
- `builtins_utils.c` - Helper functions

### Executor Components
- `executor_core.c` - Main execution logic
- `executor_pipe.c` - Pipe handling
- `executor_redir.c` - Redirection handling
- `executor_path.c` - Path resolution
- `executor_utils.c` - Utility functions

### Other Components
- `signals.c` - Signal handling
- `heredoc.c` - Heredoc implementation
- `env.c` - Environment variable management
- `parser.c`, `parser_syntax.c`, `parser_tokens.c` - Parsing
- `prompt.c` - User prompt
- `terminal.c` - Terminal handling
- `utils.c` - General utilities
